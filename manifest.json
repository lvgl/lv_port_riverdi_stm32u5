    "description": "STM32 Embedded 5” display is all-in-one complete and open-platform solution being able to independently handle the visual layer of devices with the need for high computing performance. The 5-inch STM32 Embedded Displays series are industrial-quality LCD-TFT solutions based on the STM32U599NJH6Q or STM32U5A9NJH6Q microcontroller. It has been designed in a way that allows to meet most of the hardware and programming challenges faced by engineers, including access to all interfaces.",
